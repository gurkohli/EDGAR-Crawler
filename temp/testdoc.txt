ITEM 3. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION.

On December 31, 2002, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement") dated as of such date by and among the Issuer, AIGGSEF,
AIGGEM, GEM Parallel (AIGGSEF, AIGGEM and GEM Parallel being referred to herein
as the "Lead Investors") and Duke Hotels Limited ("Duke," and together with the
Lead Investors, the "Investors"), which Purchase Agreement is filed herewith as
Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, (i) AIGGSEF
purchased 206,095 shares of the Issuer's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred"), for
<PAGE>
$15,458,475.73, (ii) AIGGEM purchased 186,371 shares of Series C Preferred for
$13,979,099.60, and (iii) GEM Parallel purchased 19,723 shares of Series C
Preferred for $1,479,376.13. Each of AIGGSEF, AIGGEM and GEM Parallel obtained
the funds used to purchase their respective shares of Series C Preferred by
contributions from their respective members or general and limited partners, as
applicable. Each share of Series C Preferred is initially convertible at any
time at the option of the holder thereof into forty (40) shares of Common Stock.

ITEM 4. PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.

Each of AIGGSEF, AIGGEM, GEM Parallel Fund acquired the securities reported
herein for investment purposes and may, from time to time, depending on such
Investor's evaluation of the market for the Common Stock, other opportunities
available to it, its financial requirements and other possible future
developments, decide to increase or decrease its holdings of the Series C
Preferred or the Common Stock into which the Series C Preferred is convertible,
including, without limitation, by converting all or any portion of the shares of
Series C Preferred into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
the Certificate of Designation in respect of the Series C Preferred filed
herewith as Exhibit 3, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety
(the "Certificate of Designation"). The response to Item 3 hereof is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety, the Lead Investors are obligated to purchase up to an
aggregate of 121,097 additional shares of Series C Preferred, as subject to
adjustment in the event of stock splits and similar events, at one or more
Subsequent Closings (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for an aggregate
maximum purchase price of $9,083,048.54 in the event that certain conditions
specified in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied, including satisfaction of one
or more of the conditions specified in Section 5.16 of the Purchase Agreement.
The maximum number of shares of Series C Preferred, as subject to adjustment in
the event of stock splits and similar events, that each of AIGGSEF, AIGGEM and
GEM Parallel Fund is obligated to purchase is 60,548, 54,754 and 5,795,
respectively. The maximum aggregate purchase price payable by each of AIGGSEF,
AIGGEM and GEM Parallel Fund for such shares is $4,541,524.27, $4,106,900.40 and
$434,623.87, respectively.

Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation, the Investors currently
have the right, among other rights set forth in the Certificate of Designation,
to elect and appoint one director (the "Preferred Director") to the Board of
Directors of the Issuer, to approve the authorization or issuance of certain
equity securities of the Issuer that are senior to or pari passu with shares of
Series C Preferred, to approve any amendment to the organizational documents of
the Issuer that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders
of shares of Series C Preferred and to exercise preemptive rights on a pro rata
basis with the other Investors in connection with certain future issuances of
securities by the Issuer. In addition, without the majority approval of the
Preferred Director and the other non-management directors of the Issuer, voting
together as a group, the Issuer may not undertake certain corporate or other
actions as specified in the Certificate of Designation. The Investors are also
entitled to performance adjustment payments under certain circumstances, which
may be payed in cash or by adjusting the conversion ratio
<PAGE>
applicable to the Series C Preferred in the discretion of the Board of Directors
of the Issuer, and weighted average anti-dilution protection in the event of
certain dilutive issuances by the Issuer, which may result in additional
adjustments to the conversion ratio applicable to the Series C Preferred.
Although the extent to which the conversion ratio may be increased is limited
due to a floor on the Effective Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate
of Designation), the foregoing rights may be deemed to impede the acquisition of
control of the Issuer by a third-party.

The Investors have exercised the right to appoint and elect one director and
have appointed and elected Mr. Paul G. Pizzani as a director of the Issuer. As a
result, the size of the Board of Directors of the Issuer has been increased to
eight directors. So long as the Investors continue to hold such right in
accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation, it is anticipated
that such right will continue to be exercised by the Investors in the future.

As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the
capitalization of the issuer has changed and is subject to further change in the
event that additional shares of Series C Preferred are issued pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
specified in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, the capitalization of the
Issuer is subject to change upon any mandatory or optional conversion of all or
any portion of the Series C Preferred into shares of Common Stock in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the Certificate of Designation.

Pursuant to that certain Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights
Agreement"), filed herewith as Exhibit 4 and incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety, by and among the Issuer and each of the Investors, each of the
Investors has been granted certain demand and "piggyback" registration rights
entitling such Investors, subject to the limitations set forth therein, to have
their respective Registrable Securities (as defined therein) registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Upon the exercise of such rights, the
Investors may dispose of Common Stock of the Issuer received upon conversion of
shares of Series C Preferred.

The foregoing summary of certain provision of the Certificate of Designation,
the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to
be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents as
filed herewith as Exhibits.

Except as contemplated by the Certificate of Designation, the Purchase Agreement
and the Registration Rights Agreement or as otherwise set forth in this Item 4,
none of the Filers, SICO, The Starr Foundation or Starr nor, to the best
knowledge of each such Filer, SICO, The Starr Foundation or Starr, their

            any of its subsidiaries;

      (iv)  any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the
            Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or

            of Directors;

            structure;

      (vii) changes in the Issuer's Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or
            instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede
            the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person;

      (viii)causing a class of securities of the Issuer to cease to be quoted
            on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

      (ix)  a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for
            termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the
